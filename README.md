# BusTracker

This is a Bus Tracker App that utilizes a Mapbox API, that tracks all the bus stops between MIT and Harvard University by manipulating the DOM which adds the animation to track the bus stops.

Some ideas I have for this would be to reflect trips ive taken with the stops included so anyone can see what I do on a vacation//trip.
